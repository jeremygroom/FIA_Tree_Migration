############ LIST OF ITEMS TO BE COMPLETED FOR ANALYSIS #############

* For Occupancy analysis, be sure to re-run GLS with 20000 iterations instead of 200.  5/11/22
* Plot 53851 STATECD 53 only has plot052120.csv values for 2018.  There are target species in the plot during the first (2008) and second visit (albeit they 
are small, with 3 with DIA < 10, one has DIA = 17). I've calculated and added the precip and temp values to the tmp.1st.2nd.csv and precip.1st.2nd.csv files. 
* We are missing temp/precip data for plot 53/97917.  Notes state that it is coastal and not forested, so I am currently removing it from the analysis.
