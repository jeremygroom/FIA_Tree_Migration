In PowerPoint:
- Save desired figure as PDF


In GIMP
Import PDF at 300dpi

- tools - selection - fuzzy select
- edit - fill with BG color

- toolbox - select figure
- Image - crop to selection

file - export as

If the figure is too large but I'd like it horizontal:
- Save as PDF from Powerpoint
- In GIMP, open the PDF at 300 dpi, crop, rotate (Image - Transform - Rotate).  Then, resize the image (Image - Scale Image). I can
maintain 300 dpi
